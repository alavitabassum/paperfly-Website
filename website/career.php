            <p>Customers want, or rather deserve, the freedom of choice!</p>
            <p>Our experience says customers browse and select products online, but the actual 'purchase' happen only after receiving the product in hand! At that moment of truth, some might choose to return the product for whatever reason, and some might want to accept only a part of it.</p>
            <p>Either way, the delivery system needs to have the capability of handling partial and return packages. And those returns need to reach merchant safely, quickly and with proper reasoning.</p>
            <p>We offer this exact service for our merchants, and the best part is - the return portion is FREE!</p>
